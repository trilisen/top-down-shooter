# Code Review by Jonathan Larsson and Agnes Binett

1. `Scene1.js:198-200` - A block of unused code
2. `Scene1.js:89` - Delta is declared but never used
3. `House.js:3` - Unused line of code
4. `index.html` - This is probably irrelevant, but instead of using flex-box and CSS to position your canvas, you could use Phaser to do it in your index.js-file under scale. (for instance: autoCenter: Phaser.Scale.CENTER_BOTH)
5. `/webpack` - Since you're already using vite - Do you still need the webpack folder?
6. `package-lock.json` - There are a lot of dependencies installed (for Babeljs for example), that I don't think you're using.
7. `Installation` - Running npm install I get 4 high severity vulnerabilities (even after running npm audit fix)
8. `Game` - Fun and addictive game overall!
9. `gun.js:27` - Forgotten console.log
10. `.babelrc` - unused?

Great job guys!
